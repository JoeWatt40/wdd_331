1) The first option is better because it is more specific and leaves out chances that you have referenced the incorrect
    element by using the second option.

2) The space makes it a descendent selector. If you use the space and if the span isn't the parent of .help it wouldn't 
    have any effect on the HTML. 

3) .help::before {
    content: '('; 
}
.help::after {
    content: ')';
}

4) title:not("fieldset3")
